Info:
PYTHONUNBUFFERED:
Setting the non-empty value of PYTHONUNBUFFERED means 
that the python output is transmitted directly to the 
terminal without being buffered and that allows displaying 
the applicationâ€™s output in real-time. 

--rm = remove
sh = shell
-c = command

docker exec -it django_container /bin/bash:
running command in container, cannot be used in alpine build. Instead use [docker exec -it django_app sh]
